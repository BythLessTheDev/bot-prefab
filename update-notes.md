# 16/12/2020
- Added `cooldowns` command:
    - you can now change the cooldowns of a command per server for each role individually
    - added `commandCooldowns` to the `guildSchema`
    - added `roleDelete.js` to check if a role with a set cooldown has been deleted (to delete it from the database and cache)
    - added the needed checks in `message.js`
    - added the package `ms` (to convert user input into milliseconds/display the cooldown in readable time and not ms)
- Updated commands
    - made some parts prettier and removed unnecessary code
    - added client perms to them
    - added timeout message to `permissions` command if they don't react to the embed
- Updated `paginate()`
    - added additional checks: e.g. when the message gets deleted while adding reactions, or inside the collector end event (because it also triggers if the message was deleted)
- Updated `registerCommands()`
    - added additional checks: e.g. when a command name or alias has already been added
    - added support for multiple command directories (e.g. you can do `registerCommands(client, '../commands', '../cmds')`)
- Updated `message.js`
    - added the cooldowns feature
    - moved client permissions check up a bit
- Added some small JSDocs snippets to `message.js` and `guildCreate.js` (will improve those in future updates for better code-autocompletion)

# 14/12/2020
- Added command categories:
    - If the `help` command is ran, an embed containing all categories will be sent
    - `help [category name]` will send an embed containing all commands of a category
    - `help [command name]` will now display the server's current prefix (to do that, inside of `command.usage`/`command.description`/`command.examples` all `PREFIX` will be replaced with the server prefix, so make sure to update your commands)
    - If no category was given, it will default to `No category`.
- Fixed guildCreate.js:
    - If bot doesn't have permissions to send messages in default channel
    - If bot doesn't have permissions to send messages in "general" channel
    - If there are no channels the bot can send messages in
- Updated registry.js:
    - Added category relevant features
- Updated main.js:
    - Added new logs
    - Stop bot if no connection to MongoDB was established
- Updated utils.js:
    - Added `log()`
- Updated all commands:
    - Added category
    - Changed `${PREFIX}` to `PREFIX`
