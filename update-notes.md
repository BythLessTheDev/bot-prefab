- The TypeScript version has been added! _Thanks to Cursors for laying the foundation <3_
    - There might be small mistakes here and there, but I haven't come across any when testing out all the commands.
    - Some of the types yet need to be improved (coming soon)
- With the addition of the TypeScript version, both versions were moved in separate folders. Read the corresponding update-notes of the versions for a more detailed explanation of the updates for each
- Removed `config.json` in favor of `config.example.json`, when trying to run the project, make sure that you added a `config.json` file with the fields shown in the example file
