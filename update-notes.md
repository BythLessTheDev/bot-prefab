# 14/12/2020
- Added command categories:
    - If the `help` command is ran, an embed containing all categories will be sent
    - `help [category name]` will send an embed containing all commands of a category
    - `help [command name]` will now display the server's current prefix (to do that, inside of `command.usage`/`command.description`/`command.examples` all `PREFIX` will be replaced with the server prefix, so make sure to update your commands)
    - If no category was given, it will default to `No category`.
- Fixed guildCreate.js:
    - If bot doesn't have permissions to send messages in default channel
